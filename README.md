# Bikestore Sales Dataset Analysis 

```sql
Tools being used for the project: SQL & Excel
```

## Overview
I will be conducting an in-depth data analysis project on the Bikestore sales dataset. Using SQL, I will clean, explore, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights. Key findings that could benefit the bike store owner will be visualized using Excel charts. This project is approached as if I am presenting the results to the store owner or a senior-level executive, providing them with a clear overview of the store's performance.

## Collecting the dataset 
The dataset that i will be using for this dataset will be attatched in a seperate folder in this repository. 

## Understanding the dataset 
This is the overall entity relationship diagram for all of the different tables.

As this is a bike store sales dataset, there are several interesting aspects we can explore. However, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the performance of specific bike brands and categories, we would need to perform multiple join statements.

## Questions that i will be exploring 
- What is the **total revenue** generated by the bike store?
- Which product has the **highest sales revenue**?
- **How many orders** have been placed in total?
- Which store has processed the **most orders**?
- What is the **total number of bikes sold per brand**?
- Which customers have placed more than X orders and spent more than $Y in total?
- What are the **top 5 best-selling products in each category**?
- **How does sales revenue trend over time** (daily, monthly, yearly)?
- Which products are **frequently bought together**?
- What is the **average time between order placement and shipment**?
- **Which store has the highest revenue per staff member**?
- What is **the customer retention rate** (percentage of repeat customers)?
- Which products are **underperforming despite having high stock levels**?
- What is the **revenue share of each brand relative to total revenue**?
- Which staff members consistently **achieve higher-than-average sales**?
