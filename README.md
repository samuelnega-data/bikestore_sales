# Bikestore Sales Dataset Analysis 

```sql
Tools being used for the project: SQL & Excel
```

## Overview
I will be conducting an in-depth data analysis project on the Bikestore sales dataset. Using SQL, I will clean, explore, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights. Key findings that could benefit the bike store owner will be visualized using Excel charts. This project is approached as if I am presenting the results to the store owner or a senior-level executive, providing them with a clear overview of the store's performance.

## Collecting the dataset 
The dataset that i will be using for this dataset will be attatched in a seperate folder in this repository. 

## Understanding the dataset 
This is the overall entity relationship diagram for all of the different tables.

As this is a bike store sales dataset, there are several interesting aspects we can explore. However, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the performance of specific bike brands and categories, we would need to perform multiple join statements.
